# ChemtoaxisModel

In this project, we devised  a mathematical model of cell migration. 

The importance of the model lies in its simplicity since it clearly demonstrate that simple mechanical forces generated within the cell or felt externally have a key role in the motion of the cell.

 There is no extrinsic feedback mechanism introduced in the model, however membrane tension and internal pressure forces inherently and intrinsically bear an adaptive feedback control. 

The spring tension tries to damp-out any change in the cell membrane when the chemoattractant forces increase and similarly the internal pressure tries to maintain the equilibrium cell area in such circumstances.
